# Dijkstra Visualizer using GraphStream Library

This project is a visualization tool for the famous Dijkstra's algorithm, implemented in Java using the GraphStream library. The purpose of this project is to help students understand how the algorithm works and how it can be used to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to have Java and GraphStream installed on your system. You can download GraphStream from the following link: [https://graphstream-project.org/download/](https://graphstream-project.org/download/).

Once you have downloaded and installed GraphStream, you can clone this repository to your local system using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/shivsarthak/Dijkstra-Visualizer.git
```
## Usage

To use this tool, you need to run the ``src/main/java/project/App.java`` file. This will launch the application and display a window where you can see the graph output.

## Acknowledgments

This project was developed as part of the End Term project for the Analysis and Design Of Algorithms subject at college (The Northcap University). We would like to thank our professor for providing us with the opportunity to work on this project and for his guidance throughout the development process. We would also like to thank the GraphStream community for developing such a powerful and easy-to-use library.
